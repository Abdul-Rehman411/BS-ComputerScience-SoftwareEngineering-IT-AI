        <p><b><h1>What Is Software Engineering?</h1>
        <a href="#bottom">Software engineering is the application of engineering concepts to software development.</a>
        Its main goal is the creation, improvement, and maintenance of software. 
        Software engineering takes into account engineering aspects
        like the hardware and software environment when working on a program.</b>
        <i>While software engineers’ job descriptions often heavily overlap with software developers,
        software engineers and software developers are not the same. </i>
        <u>The main difference is that software engineers apply engineering concepts and principles to software development. 
        Engineers consider beyond the code they’re writing and onto the environment that the program will reside.</u></p>

        
        <p><b><h2>What Does a Software Engineer Do?</h2></b>
        Software engineers work on creating, maintaining, and managing software applications of various types. 
        Below are some duties of software engineers,
        <ol>
        <li><b>Updating Programs</b></li>
        Software engineers ensure an active program runs smoothly through updates and bug fixes.<br/>
        <li><b>Creating new programs</b></li>
        <a href="https://careerkarma.com/careers/software-engineer/">Software engineers design and create new programs for users.</a><br/>
        <li><b>Analysis</b></li>
        Software engineers may look at an organization's needs and create software to meet such needs.<br/>
        <li><b>Keep track of software development</b></li>
        Creating software often involves the work of multiple teams.
        Software engineers keep track of internal code and ensure the application meets the users' needs.</p>
        </ol>
        
        <p><b><h3>Types of Software Engineering</h3></b>
            If you want to break into tech engineering, the first step is figuring out which career path you want to target. 
            Let's cover some of the more popular paths for software engineers.</p>
        <dl>
        <p><b><dt>Software Engineer</dt></b>
        Software engineers develop software for electronic devices. 
        These developers use programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python to 
        create applications that will run on computers. They work on both the user interface and the back-end, 
        which refer to what the user sees and the mechanics that make a program work, respectively.</p>

        <p id="bottom"> <p><b><dt>Embedded System Engineers</dt></b>
        These engineers are responsible for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining 
        embedded systems. Embedded systems are combinations of hardware and software designed
        to perform specific tasks. For example, an embedded systems engineer may work on the 
        software which powers ATMs or the program which controls a robot.</p>

        <p><b><dt>Security Engineer</dt></b>
        A security engineer is responsible for creating systems, methods, and 
        policies to ensure an information system meets certain standards and has no security flaws. 
        Security engineers often operate as “white-hat” ethical hackers and 
        attempt to break into existing systems to determine if any security problems exist.</p>

        <p><b><dt>Quality Assurance Engineer</dt></b>
        Quality Assurance (QA) engineers write, review, test, and maintain software. 
        These engineers are responsible for ensuring the development team writes a consistent quality of code. 
        They create standards and policies to ensure all code is efficient and works correctly.
