# BS-ComputerScience-SoftwareEngineering-IT-AI
This repo contains data of the courses taught in the BS Degree of [Computer Science (CS), Software Engineering (SE), and Information Technology (IT)]. 
<br> <br>
Data of the courses includes Books, Lectures, Notes, Program/Coding Files, etc. and much more. <br><br>
**Note:** Assignments, Quizzes, Projects, and Presentations are not included because those are the soul source of learning opportunities for you in the university/college. If you copy those things you will not going to learn any thing during your degree. So please do some efforts and try to build those things on your own if you want to learn practically. <br><br>
### Instructions for Contribution
If you want to contribute a full course please make a separate folder for it. If you want to contribute in an existing course, then please contribute to the respective folder of that course i.e. Notes in the notes folder of the course and coding files in the coding/programs folder of the course.
